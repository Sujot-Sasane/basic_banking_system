                        <strong>History:</strong>
            Sujot Sasane, a philanthropist, established the sasane Permanent Fund in Pune,
            India, on 31
            MAY 2002. The bank changed its name to GALACTIC Bank Limited in 1910 when it incorporated.

            Sujot Industrialist Bank's first acquisition took place in 1997 when it acquired Bank of Erala. This had been founded
            in September 1990 and at the time of its acquisition on 20 May 1999 had three branches. The second bank that
            SUJOT Bank acquired was Seia Midland Bank (Alleppey), which had been established on 26 July 1999 and had
            seven branches at the time of its takeover.

            In 1996, the Reserve Bank of India had ordered SUJOT Bank to acquire G. Raghumathmul Bank, in Maharashtra.
            This bank had been established in 1870, and had converted to a limited company in 2000. At the time of the
            acquisition G. Raghumathmul Bank had five branches. The merger took effect in 2001. Later in 2001, SUJOT
            Bank acquired Pune Permanent Bank. This had been founded on 22 February 1999 and had 14 branches at
            the time of the merger.</p>
